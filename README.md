# Introduction
Welcome to the __Redux JSON API__ we ‚ù§Ô∏è JSON and we love simple api's. With this in mind was this libiary born. We strive to keep this libiary as small but as powerfull as possible so it would be easy adaptable into any `JSON API` stack enviroment.

We would love all of you users, to open disscusions/issues with us, that can make this tool pleasent for all to use, and ther for give a better libiary in the end. And if you build somthing with it, please let us know so we can see the cool stuff you are doing!

If there is anything that you feel is not documented, or could be refered better to such as things from `redux` let us know aswell.

The reason for this repository is to keep on a good and healty & simple api for _JSON API_, for Redux applications weahter you use it in _react_ or any other framework of choise. Feel like getting envolved into to this, then get cloning and follow our simple guide lines, if you just want to give feedback or report bug click that [issues](https://github.com/dixieio/redux-json-api/issues) button and lets talk about it.

### Development Guidelines
We have a few simple guidelines for how to develop on the tool, and how to build and test it locally.
#### Test the code
Beside writing the cases that you might create, there is also a need for you to test the code localy in your project, this can be set up using the `npm link` [How to use npmn link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link), before creating the link you would need to build the code.

#### Build the code
To build the code for local testing purposed run `npm run build`, this will dist the code make it able to be a part of the node_modules packages in your applications repo.

#### Create a PR
You have done really cool work, __KUDOS__! üéâ, now you want to contrubute the code and you create a _PR_, we will then review the pull request.
